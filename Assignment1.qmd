## Introduction

The aim of this paper is to identify different machine learning models that can be used for predictive purposes, and rank them according to their ability to do so. With presidential speech from 1994 to 2022 from South African presidents, this paper will review the capacity in which classification trees , neural networks and random forests are able to accurately classify sentences to their presidents. The input structuring process will also vary so as to ascertain which of the few is most suitable for the data at hand.
